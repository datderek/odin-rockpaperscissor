### Conclusions
Really fun project that highlighted some basic HTML, CSS, Javascript

What I learned from this lesson:
* How to create a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (i.e. taking in user input to the rock paper scissors game)
* Practiced selecting, editing, and inserting HTML elements through Javascript
* Practiced styling and organizing a page through flexbox
* Practiced CSS animations but realized there is a lot more too learn
* Tried to sequence CSS animations using Javascript (brute forced, research should there was a better way to do it through "Promise")

What I want to do differently:
* Better understand how to create 3D animations, the intial "Star Wars" animation was just copied from a tutorial
* Learn how to use Promise object in Javascript to sequence animations
