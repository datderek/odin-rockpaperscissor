            In a kitchen far, far away,
            a couple's hunger sets the stage.
            Bound by love, they seek a resolution
            from above. Their evening's feast, a question unknown,
            a game shall decide, their paths to be shown.
            </p>
            <p>
            With mischief in her eyes, she proposes,
            a contest of wits, as hunger imposes.
            Undaunted, he accept the game, in the kitchen's
            realm, destiny takes aim. As anticipation fills the air,
            They stand ready, a verdict to bear.
            The moment approaches, tension ignites.
            </p>
            <p>
            Together they shout...
